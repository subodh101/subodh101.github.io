Hello folks, I am a Software Engineer in Mercari, Japan. My main focus is Machine Learning.

After completing my bachelors I joined Mercari and came to Japan in October 2018. There I created a violation detection multimodal and also did serving by myself. Then I got interested in serving ML models at scale because there are tons of models out there but how to make it useful was the thing that I found very exciting. So I joined ML Platform team and started doing MLOps.

Apart from my professional life, I love authentic cuisines, traveling, investing, poker, guitar.
